# ADDRESS-BOOK

An address book project created with the use of basic frontend technologies + Pug and SQLite.

So far the app allows you to add addresses, and then edit and remove one or all of them. Once you add an address, an SQLite file will be created to store all the data.

Commands to run the project: npm install, node app.js

Then go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
